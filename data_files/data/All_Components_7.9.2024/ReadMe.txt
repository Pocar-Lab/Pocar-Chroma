Simulation Created on 7/9/2024 by Loick Marion

Most previous experiments use simplified versions of the geometries that contain only the most important components. 
The purpose of this experiment is to determine whether this simplification has an impact on the PTE.

The default bulk materials and surface property files will be used.

The geometry component file will be modified between runs.  One run will contain only a handful of the components.
 A second run will add the rest of the components but designate them as killing surfaces.
 A third run will allow the photons to reflect off of all the components.
 
 There will be 2 geometry components for this experiment as this test will be performed on 2 different geometries.

one geometry is the geometry for an experiment called 'geometry for daksh'. The second is from an experiment called 
'Sebastian_FS_06.08.2023_correctedSiPM'

In the copper experiment, I could not find previous isntances of the fiber optic cable i geometry components, so i assumed it was made out of silica.
